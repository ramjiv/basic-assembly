# Basic Assembly

Objective:
* Understanding imperative programming and control flow
* Feeling like a nerdyrock star because you understand something nobody else does.
* Writing a basic piece of assembly that performs a simple context switch

Key Results:
* comfortable with a trivial assembly language so that you can map the programming constructs up and down the stack.
* It's not about the syntax, almost nobody writes assembly, and if they do, it's a LOT more complex than what we will do
